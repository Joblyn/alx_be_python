# This program calculates the simple interest.
# Formula: I = (R * T * P)
# ( I ) is the interest earned,
# ( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
# ( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
# ( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.

principal = 1000 # principal amount in $
rate = 0.05  # 5% interest rate
time = 3  # in years

interest = rate * time * principal
print("The simple interest is:", interest)

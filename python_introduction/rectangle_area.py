# This program calculates the area of a rectangle.
# Formula: A = L * W
# ( A ) is the area,
# ( L ) is the length of the rectangle,
# ( W ) is the width of the rectangle.

length = 10  # length of the rectangle
width = 5   # width of the rectangle

area = length * width
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
